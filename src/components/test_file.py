This is a test. I am creating in test3 branch.s

This is being added on branch test4.

this is a new line being added on test branch 5. It is up to date with main branch
but not up to date wiht testbranch4, as the merge between testbranch4 and main has
not yet been completed. 

I need to commit these changes. first, lets complete merge between main and tb4.
Then go back to main, fetch changes. Then merge main with tb5. then commit and we should 
have all the changes together. 

I am adding these lines on test5.
Lets pretend that I made these changes, but I want to revert to the state of the file when I first created the branch.

If I stage this file now, lets see what happens.
