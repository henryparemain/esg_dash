Beginning in FY2021, we’re accounting for scope 2 emissions from the\\npurchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam.\\n4. In fiscal year 2017, we started calculating scope 3 emissions not listed in\\nthis table. In fiscal year 2021, these include electricity transmission and\\ndistribution losses amounted to about 28,000 metric tons CO2e and life\\ncycle emissions associated with renewable energy amounted to about\\n95,000 metric tons CO2e. We have not accounted for emissions resulting\\nfrom employees working from home, because we anticipated these\\nemissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving\\nour methodology.\\n5. We regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability\\nstandards. So in fiscal year 2018, we changed how we calculate emissions\\nfrom business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air\\ntravel. As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissions\\nincreased by 77 percent between 2017 and 2018. Without the methodology\\nchange, these emissions would have increased by 14 percent, which reflects\\nthe growth in our business.\\n6. Beginning in fiscal year 2020, we updated our methodology to reflect the\\nimpact of COVID-19 on employee commute.\\n7. We retired 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits from the Chyulu Hills project\\nin Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal\\nyear 2021. This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards.\\n8. Because we’re committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refine\\nour product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. For example,\\nwe recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our\\nproducts are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid\\nemission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. The\\nnet result was an increase in our 2021 carbon footprint. When using the\\nsame level of data granularity and model as 2021, our product use carbon\\nemissions in 2021 would have been about 2.5 percent lower.\\n9. For fiscal year 2021, we retired credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya,\\nand purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total\\nof 500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain. The first\\nproject, a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala, protects and\\nconserves forests from deforestation and degradation. The second project\\naims to establish forests on about 46,000 hectares of barren land that is not\\notherwise in use across seven counties in the Guizhou Province of China.\\nBoth projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for\\nprojects in the Restore Fund, including VCS and CCBS.
