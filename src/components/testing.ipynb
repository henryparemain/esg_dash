      "Our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program maps the chemicals used in our products — an effort that includes tens of thousands of parts and assemblies. Then we look at how our products are manufactured. Our Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) program engages with supply chain partners to get the most recent information on which materials are in use. This information includes the volume of materials being consumed and how they’re being applied, stored, and handled — as well as the steps being taken to protect employees. More than 1000 supplier facilities have shared their chemical inventories as well as storage and safety protocols as part of our CSD program. Through this process, we’ve identified more than 17,000 chemicals and applications. These efforts contribute to a safer work environment for people across our supply chain.\n"
